Kodi Resume V.0.0.1 by Matt Huisman

Summary
Resumes selectable states (music, video, slideshow, window etc) by monitoring and saving the current states into a database at a defined interval. 
It then resumes the saved state on Kodi start-up. Due to the constant monitoring, the script is designed to work with unexpected Kodi shutdowns.

Features
* Resume currently playing video, video position & video playlist
* Resume currently playing audio, audio position & audio playlist
* Resume currently playing slideshow
* Resume current window & path (eg: TV Shows/Family Guy/Season 1/)
* Resume current volume & mute status (off by default as Kodi stores these - however, can enable to allow for over-ride of Kodi stored value)
* Settings change monitor (no need to restart Kodi for new settings to take affect)
* Ability to fully disable monitoring and/or resuming
* Resumes media items by their library id's if possible (keeps correct file-name, art etc)
